# 🏝️ @pinonym

I'm a curious builder at the intersection of **maths**, **coding**, and **the sea**.  
Originally trained in **maths and computer science**, I'm now a **second-year nursing student**, passionate about clean code, open-source tools, and useful tech — especially for the outdoors.

## ⚡ Current Focus: [Koast](https://github.com/pinonym/koast)

A mobile-first app for **coastal navigation and safety**, built for kayakers, paddleboarders, and anyone who explores the sea from the shore.  
Real-time GPS, compass, live marine weather, draggable buoys — all in one clean and minimal interface.
Contact-me if you're interessed!
